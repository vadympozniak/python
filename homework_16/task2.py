"""Mathematician
Implement a class Mathematician which is a helper class for doing math operations on lists
The class doesn't take any attributes and only has methods:
square_nums (takes a list of integers and returns the list of squares)
remove_positives (takes a list of integers and returns it without positive numbers
filter_leaps (takes a list of dates (integers) and removes those that are not 'leap years'"""

        a_list = []
        for i in list:
            a_list.append(i ** 2)
        return a_list

    def remove_positives(self, list):
        a_list = []
        for i in list:
            if not (i > 0):
                a_list.append(i)
