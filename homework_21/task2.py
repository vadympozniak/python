"""Writing tests for context manager
Take your implementation of the context manager class from Task 1
and write tests for it. Try to cover as many use cases as you can, positive
ones when a file exists and everything works as designed. And also, write tests
when your class raises errors or you have errors in the runtime context suite."""
